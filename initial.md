# Google Timeline Map App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A web application that allows users to visualize their Google Timeline data on an interactive world map with boundary drawing capabilities, similar to Redfin and Zillow's map features.

## Core Features

### 1. World Map Display
- Interactive world map using a mapping library (Leaflet/Mapbox/Google Maps)
- Zoom, pan, and navigation controls
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### 2. Boundary Drawing Tool
- Polygon drawing tool for creating custom boundaries
- Multiple boundary support
- Boundary editing and deletion
- Visual feedback during drawing process

### 3. Google Timeline Data Upload
- File upload interface for Google Timeline JSON/KML files
- Data parsing and validation
- Progress indicators for large files
- Data storage and management

### 4. Map Navigation Tools
- Search functionality with geocoding
- Current location detection
- Zoom controls
- Layer toggles

### 5. Timeline Data Visualization
- Display visited places within drawn boundaries
- Visit frequency analysis
- Time-based filtering
- Detailed place information popups

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js with React-Leaflet
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand
- **File Handling**: File API for uploads

### Backend Stack (Optional for MVP)
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (for MVP) or PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local storage initially, cloud storage later

### Key Libraries
- `react-leaflet` - Map integration
- `@turf/turf` - Geospatial calculations
- `papaparse` - CSV/JSON parsing
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation
- `lucide-react` - Icons

## Design Inspiration
- **Redfin**: Clean map interface, intuitive drawing tools
- **Zillow**: Search functionality, property markers
- **Google Maps**: Familiar navigation patterns
- **Modern web apps**: Clean, minimal design with good UX

## Success Metrics
- Smooth map interaction (60fps)
- Fast data upload and processing
- Intuitive boundary drawing experience
- Accurate place detection within boundaries
- Responsive design across devices

## Risk Mitigation
- **Large file handling**: Implement chunked processing
- **Map performance**: Use clustering for markers
- **Browser compatibility**: Test across major browsers
- **Data privacy**: Client-side processing initially

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create project structure
3. Install dependencies
4. Begin Phase 1 development
